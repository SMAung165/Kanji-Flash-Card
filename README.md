# 🎴 KanjiFlash

A console-based Kanji flashcard quiz app built with Java — because why not combine JLPT prep with Java practice? Study smarter, not harder. 勉強しろ！😄

---

## ✨ Features

- **JLPT Level Selection** — practice N5 through N1
- **Custom card count** — choose how many Kanji to study per session
- **Multiple choice quiz** — 4 randomized choices per card
- **Smart wrong answer generation** — wrong choices come from the same JLPT level, never duplicates the correct answer
- **Score tracking** — see how many you got right at the end
- **Mistake review** — review every card you got wrong with the correct reading
- **JSON-based Kanji database** — clean, maintainable data source per JLPT level

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Abstract classes — `Flashcard` as base template
- Interfaces — `Reviewable` contract
- OOP — encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- JSON loading — GSON with custom field mapping
- ArrayList — dynamic deck and history management
- Package structure — real-world `com.soemoe.kanjiflashcard` layout
- Input validation — `ValidationUtils` shared utility
